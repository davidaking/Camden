This project uses Python to retrieve data relating to the London Borough of Camden from various sources, saves it in a SQLite data and builds an R Markdown flexdashboard html output file.

The idea is to analyse locations within Camden by LSOA, IMD and population.

There are scripts called 00_get-path in both the python and R directories that set up variable to represent directories in the project that are used in the other scripts.
